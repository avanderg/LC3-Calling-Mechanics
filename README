This project was to write a simple C program that prompts the user for an
input string and a character, then it returns the number of occurances in the 
input string then convert it to assembly (LC3). charCount uses a recursive
function to count the characters and so does the assembly version. The point
of the project was to learn about function call mechanics in assembly. Running
the assembly program requires the lc3 simulator (lc3sim and lc3as).

To make both programs run:
    $ make
To make just the C program run:
    $ make charCount
To make just the LC3 program run:
    $ make charCount_a

To run the C program:
    $ C/charCount

To run the LC3 program:
    $ cd LC3
    $ lc3sim
Then in the simulator:
    (lc3sim) file charCount
    (lc3sim) file main
    (lc3sim) continue

Make sure to load charCount before main because the pc needs to be pointing
at main for the program to run.
